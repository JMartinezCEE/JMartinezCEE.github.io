Welcome!  I am a Senior Computational Engineer at Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). I specialize in developing computational labs and assignments using tools such as COMSOL, Abaqus, MATLAB, and Python, designed to enhance student learning experience. My expertise lies in advising students across many disciplines with their computational needs, covering areas such as finite element analysis, numerical methods, data science, and machine learning. My current interests include leveraging Generative AI to transform how students engage with complex engineering problems and exploring the how G-AI can revolutionize educational methodologies in engineering. 

I earned a PhD and Masters of Science in Engineering (MSE) in  in Civil Engineering from the University of Michigan and my Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from The City College of New York (CUNY).
